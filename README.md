# Personal Productivity App (GTD-Based)

This is a basic **Personal Productivity App** built using **React Native with Expo**. It follows the principles of the **"Getting Things Done" (GTD)** methodology and helps users to:

- Capture tasks in an inbox
- Organize tasks into projects and contexts
- Engage with filtered Next Actions

--

###  Capture
- Add any new task or to-do item to the **Inbox**.

###  Process & Organize
- Move tasks from Inbox to **Projects** or mark them as **Next Actions**.
- Assign **Contexts** like `@home`, `@computer`, or `@errands`.
- Create multiple Projects.

###  Engage
- View all Next Actions.
- Filter tasks by **Project** or **Context**.
- Mark tasks as **Complete**.
